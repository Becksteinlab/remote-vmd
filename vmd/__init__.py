 VMD control
=============

Simple client to transmit Tcl commands to a server running in `VMD`_.

VMD and the server run locally and can be started from the module. Once the
server is running, one can use :class:`vmd.client` to communicate with the server
process via a local socket.

Example
-------

Start a VMD server and connect::

  from vmd.control import *
  VMD = server()
  VMD.command('molecule new load 1AKE')

or start an interactive `Tcl`_ session connected to a running VMD
server process::

  interactive(host)
  asyncore.loop()      # necessary

See `VMD Tcl Text Commands`_ for all available commands.
