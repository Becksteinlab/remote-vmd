 `vmd` --- Remote Tcl commands in VMD
===========================================

The :mod:`vmd` module contains a very simple client that can connect to a
locally running server process in `VMD`_. This allows running VMD
`Tcl`_ commands remotely. See `VMD Tcl Text Commands`_ for all
available commands.
