 :mod:`vmd` --- Remote Tcl commands in VMD
===========================================

The :mod:`vmd` module contains a very simple client that can connect to a
locally running server process in `VMD`_. This allows running VMD
`Tcl`_ commands remotely. See `VMD Tcl Text Commands`_ for all
available commands.

The :mod:`vmd` module is independent from :mod:`gromacs` and
distribute for convenience. It can be used to implement additional
visualization and analysis tasks.
